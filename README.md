About the Project
This dashboard is my attempt to turn raw HR data into meaningful insights that help understand what’s really happening in a company’s workforce. Built entirely in Power BI, this project covers everything from employee movement and leaves to salary distribution, engagement, and performance — all in one place.

I created this as part of my internship, and the goal was simple:
Make HR data easier to explore, understand, and use for better decisions.
